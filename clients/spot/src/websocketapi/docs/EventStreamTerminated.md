### NewEventStreamTerminated

`func NewEventStreamTerminated() *EventStreamTerminated`

NewEventStreamTerminated instantiates a new EventStreamTerminated object

and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

GetE returns the E field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetEOk

`func (o *EventStreamTerminated) GetEOk() (*int64, bool)`

GetEOk returns a tuple with the E field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetE
